We will be using pull requests to merge in code to the master branch. Please create branches for individual features, bug fixes, etc and  then make a pull request. Here's more info on using pull requests: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

It is highly recommended that new users to git use forks and branches on their forks. To sync up the fork with new changes in WhitworthUniversity's repo check out this help article: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork
